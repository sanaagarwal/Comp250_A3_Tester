# Comp250_A3_Tester

This a tester created for the various methods on Assignment 3 CatCafe for COMP 250 - Fall 22. I used the same format as in the prof's minitester. This contains testers for methods and edge cases not included in the minitester.

So far it has testers for:
1. `hire()` to test rotations
2. `retire()` to test rotations
3. `retire()` edge cases
4. `findMostSenior()` and `findMostJunior()`
5. `CatCafe (CatCafe cafe)` constructor
6. `buildHallOfFame()`
7. `CatCafeIterator`

## How to use:
You can either download the `A3_Tester2.java` file and add it in your main package, or copy the code and create your own class. If you create your own class, make sure to rename the class that has the main method in it as well.
